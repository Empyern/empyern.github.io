<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Having only an antique laptop for me to play with,I often struggled with keeping up with the Joneses in playing the all the latest games that was coming out at the time.
<p>

<p>
Hence,During a moment of annoyance and frustration,I made up my mind to optimize the windows operating system to the best of my abilites,leading me down a very very deep rabbit hole.One that lead me to discover my interest in technology.<br>
At first,It was rather tame,searching up on a web engine and trying out the many links it gave me,be it github,majorgeeks,etc.Than,the "performance" started worsening again.So,I decided to just bit the bullet and reinstall the windows operating system.<br>
