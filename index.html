I found windows too slowly,found out about linux and decided to use it as it was simply more responsive and yet used less resources.Furthermore,since i dont use professional or niche software,there are often FOSS alternatives for the common software that i used on windows

<p style="color : #9ca1aa">
Having only an antique laptop for me to play with,I often struggled with keeping up with the Joneses in playing the all the latest games that was coming out at the time.
Hence,During a moment of annoyance and frustration,I made up my mind to optimize the windows operating system to the best of my abilites,leading me down a very very deep rabbit hole.One that lead me to discover my interest in technology.
<br>
At first,It was rather tame,searching up on a web engine and trying out the many links it gave me,be it github,majorgeeks,etc.Than,the "performance" started worsening again.So,I decided to just bit the bullet and reinstall the windows operating system.
This was initally quite useful as it completely reset whatever bloatware I had added in the process in the name of debloating.This however led to me still finding that it wasnt optimized enough,the system lagging while trying to launch any big software that required any real processing power to run.
This lead to realizing that my laptop probably wasnt going to be running any high fidelity games,making me resign to my fate of only being to run google chrome and the one youtube tab.
<br>
However,it was around this time I discovered about the Linux operating system.I heard rumors about how it was great for low end laptop,how it would make it seem like it was brand new,how it would make any old laptop into an powerhouse.(Un)Fortunately,I believed in those rumors,deciding to try unbutu
as it looked rather user friendly at that time.And so,I decided to try it out before truly deciding whether i truly wanted to waste anymore time on it,installing it side by side with windows on the same partition.This was a terrible decision looking back now as many applications couldnt run and the disk space usuage was truly something else.
After a while of using it back and forth,I keep encountering random issues that really hampered my user experience and first experience of linux,be it random stutters or the apt package manager being too slow or just being janky in general.And so,I decided to use windows fully once more,finding linux to be just some niche operating system for hobbyist or just tech masochist in general.
<br>
However,This decision would come back to haunt me,Windows starting to experience rather random issues for no apparant issues,with most solutions being a sideproduct of normal usage of windows.This frustrated me,wanting an operating system that just worked and wouldnt randomly die on me for just not using it for a while.Some google searches later,Linux once more popped out.
This time,I decided to do some research before chosing some random distribution that some guy on the internet compiled and posted on the internet.Whats this?An supposed distro that is super flexible and customizable?Sign me up!And so,I did some research on this distro called <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>",Not knowing what kind of rabbit hole that i had voluntary hopped in.
An Gui installer for this cool linux distro?Why not?And so,I installed <a href="https://archcraft.io/"> Archcraft </a>,a supposed gui front end installer for arch linux with riceses that are pre setup for you.A few hours later and I'm running this really cool operating system that used less resources while running this web browser called firefox than windows on idle.
Thats really cool.I really wonder whether there are any cool rices out there.A few more google searches later and I've stumbled onto this cool rice that I wanted to try installing by owl4ce,<a href="https://github.com/owl4ce/dotfiles">This Openbox rice</a>.A few days later and I've managed to completely bork the system.Guess it for another reinstall.
<br>
A few reinstalls and months later,I gave up and returned to using windows,though now with a burning passion to customize.A few reinstalls of windows later,I decided to actually take my time following and learning by installing arch linux the hard way,through the terminal.This taught me many things such as most of the coreutils commands are just abbvs.
Many more reinstalls and attempts at ricing later,I finally got to a state i liked.Not a fully fledged desktop environment like gnome or kde but a window manager with some utils that i commonly used and a custom setup palette of commands that i was familar with.
<br>
Looking Back,I realized that i had gone through the linux experience the long and hard way,basically just jumping straight into one of the harder linux distros without knowing much about linux at all.It could have been a much simpler journey for me should i have chosen linux mint/fedora/etc or any user friendly distro.However,I also wouldnt have learnt a lot about linux should i had done so
This had led to me wanting to know about how the internet and how our hardware and software interacts with it.
